## My process

- Process was pretty straight forward throughout the challenge. Building the structure div-by-div didn't take too long and the overall format of the page wasn't so complicated.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Still struggling to work with responsive images and working with images is still a bit of an "awkward" experience personally so I really do have to work on that aspect of frontend more.
